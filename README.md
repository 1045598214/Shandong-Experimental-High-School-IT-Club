Founded by @ShunzheMa
The purpose of the IT Club is to make everyone feel the magic of computer programming that we can use it to solve real-life problems. We learn some new technologies like cloud computing and big data, and we made an app to score the beauty of your face from 1 to 10 using these techniques. We use Adobe's software to make our 3D movies and perfect them. All in all, in this club, I guide them and give them ideas, and they are in groups that they can try to do these things by themselves. IT Club makes me learn how to organize lectures, how to make your audience feel interested and also it inspires all the people who are enjoying it and me.
